# Debug & Design Notes

This folder contains debugging notes and design considerations created during
the development of Business Layer models.

The purpose of these documents is to:
- Explain non-obvious modeling decisions
- Document assumptions and data limitations
- Show how data issues were identified and resolved

These notes are not part of the final Business Layer outputs,
but provide transparency into the development and reasoning process.
